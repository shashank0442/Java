### Encapsulation :

> It is a fundamental OOP (object-oriented programming) principle that combines data and methods in a class.</H6>
><li> Create a class with private variables</li>
><li> Create setter and getters for the variables</li>
><li> Call the setter getters to set or get the values.</li>

### Access Modifiers:

> <p>Java has four access modifiers:</p>
><li>private: The most restrictive access level. Members declared as private are only accessible within the same class.</li>
><li>default (no modifier): When no access modifier is specified, it is considered default access. Members with default access are accessible within the same package, but not from outside the package.</li>
><li>protected: Members declared as protected are accessible within the same package and by subclasses, even if the subclasses are in a different package.</li>
><li>public: The least restrictive access level. Members declared as public are accessible from any other class, regardless of the package.</li>
